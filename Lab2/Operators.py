# #Identity Operations 
# x is y      # Returns True if x and y are the same object
# x is not y  # Returns True if x and y are not the same object

# #Membership Operators
# x in y      # Returns True if x is present in y
# x not in y  # Returns True if x is not present in y

# #Bitwise Operators
# x & y   # AND: Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# x | y   # OR: Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1
# x ^ y   # XOR: Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1
# ~x      # NOT: Inverts all the bits
# x << 2  # Left shift: Shifts bits of x left by 2 positions, filling with zeros
# x >> 2  # Right shift: Shifts bits of x right by 2 positions, filling with leftmost bit (sign-extended)
